Hi, my name is Lum. I love programming to solve problems in maths and physics.<br>
I have to self-teach many of the things I want to learn, and I find writing about them helps.


I am studying scientific computing at the University of Bayreuth.

The font I used to create the logo is [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat).
