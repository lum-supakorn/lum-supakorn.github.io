![Lum](/images/lum.jpg)

Hi, my name is Lum. I'm an engineer from Thailand.\
I love programming to solve problems in maths and physics.\
I have to self-teach many of the things I want to learn and I find writing about them helps.

I got a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering and am currently working as a computational engineer at [HiveGround](https://www.hiveground.com/).
