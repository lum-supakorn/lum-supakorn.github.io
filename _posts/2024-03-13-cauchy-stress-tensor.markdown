This note was motivated by a question that arose while I was studying the mathematics of the equation of motion of a fluid. More specifically, the question is about how the surface force on a fluid element is modeled. I was reading *Vectors, Tensors and the Basic Equations of Fluid Mechanics* by Rutherford Aris. To work with the contact force that a fluid element exerts on one another, the **traction vector** is introduced. Suddenly, Cauchy's principle is stated. It says that this traction vector, which models the contact force at any point in the fluid, depends on the position, the time, and the orientation of the surface element.

My question is:
- How is it possible that there are infinite traction vectors at a single point inside a fluid? If the distribution of the contact force inside a fluid is a vector field, shouldn't there be a single contact force at any point?
