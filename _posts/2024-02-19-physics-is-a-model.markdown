Among the ideas that influence my thinking as an engineer the most is the notion that *physics is a model*.

For some people with proper training this might sound obvious, but to me it wasn't. And once I realized this, it changed the way I work for the better.

Throughout my life I was taught that physics is *the* law. While this might be true is some sense, it led me and many students to think that to study anything we just need to look up the relevant set of laws, do some maths, and report the result. This line of thought has caused some serious issues in engineering. The notion that everything obeys the law prevented us from questioning the law in the first place. Somebody discovered such and such laws and this is how the universe works. End of story.

In fact, physics is not how the universe works at all. We do *not* actually know how the universe works because so far no-one has ever told us how it works. Imagine watching a basketball game for the first time without being told the rules of the sport. After watching several games and attentively recording their observation, one might be able to deduce the set of rules that they think govern the game.

However, that observation and deduction, no matter how meticulous, do not lead to the actual rules. It may not even be accurate. For example, it is possible to watch hundreds of imaginary games without seeing a three-pointer shot once. If one uses the observation they collected from these games, they will incorrectly predict the score a player gets from making a shot beyond the three-point line. Unless you are given the rule book, you can never be sure about how the game works.

Now apply this idea to the immensely more complex setting that is the universe. All of physics is the struggle to craft our own rule book from our observation of the universe. What we have is never a replica of the actual rule book, but a *model*, what we *think* how the universe works and what we can use to make stuff. *Physics is a model*. And although [all models are wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong), they can be very useful.

Thinking of physics as a model instead of a law makes me more careful when applying it to design and analyze things. A model was made. It was developed. It therefore must come with definitions, assumptions, and limitations. Moreover, since physics is not a law, one phenomenon might be compatible with multiple models. It is up to the engineer to select the best models when working with physics. Just like selecting the best tools to build a chair.

When I am given a task to design or analyze something I am not familiar with, I do not look for a law. Instead, I ask: how do people model this thing and what are the limitations that come with this modeling? With this idea, I am able to produce more accurate and therefore more useful work.
